### About me
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at The University of Chicago, Booth School of Business. I'm broadly interested in statistics, optimization, and probability. 
My recent research interests include high dimensional statistics in the proportional regime (p/n -> constant), high dimensional probability, and diffusion model. 

### Education 
* 2024-present. PhD student in Econometrics and Statistics at The University of Chicago, Booth School of Business. Advisor: [Tengyuan Liang](https://tyliang.github.io/). 
* 2022-2024. PhD student in Statistics at Rutgers University. 
Advisors: [Pierre C. Bellec](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/PCB71/) and [Qiyang Han](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/qh85/).
* 2018-2022. Bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics, The University of Tokyo. 
Advisors: [Takeru Matsuda](http://www.stat.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~t-matsuda/) and [Fumiyasu Komaki](http://www.stat.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~komaki/index-e.html).

<!-- ### Misc 
I received my bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from UTokyo. During the undergraduate study I was also working at RIKEN CBS as a student reseacher where I was working on combinatorial stochastic processes. After that, I moved to Rutgers Stat as a PhD student and spend two years. At Rutgers I was working on high dim stat with professor Pierre C Bellec.  -->
