### About me
I am a prospective PhD student at The University of Chicago, Booth School of Business.
I'm broadly interested in statistics, probability, and optimization. My recent research interests include:
* High dimensional statistics in the proportional asymptotic regime p/n -> constant
* High dimensional probability and convex geometry
* Infinite-dimensional optimization problem


### Education
