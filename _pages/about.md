I am a prospective PhD student at ---. I'm currently interested in the following topics:
* Statistical and computational learning theory
* High-dimensional statistics in proportional regime p/n -> constant
* Intersection of convex geometry and high-dimensional probability

### Education
* 2022-2024. PhD student in the department of statistics at Rutgers University, advised by [Pierre C. Bellec](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/PCB71/). I transferred to --- after passing the qualifying exam. 
* 2018-2022. B.E. in Mathematical Engineering (\approx Math&CS), the University of Tokyo, advised by [Fumiyasu Komaki](http://www.stat.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~komaki/index-e.html). In 2022, I was working as a part-time researcher at RIKEN, mentored by [Takeru Matsuda](http://www.stat.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~t-matsuda/).
