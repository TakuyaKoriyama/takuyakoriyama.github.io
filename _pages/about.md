<!-- ### About me
I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at The University of Chicago, Booth School of Business. I'm broadly interested in mathematical theory and algorithm for statistics and machine learning. -->

<!-- Before joining UChicago, I spent two years as a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Rutgers University, working with Professor [Pierre C. Bellec](https://statweb.rutgers.edu/PCB71/). 

I received my Bachelor’s degree in 2022 from [the University of Tokyo](https://www.keisu.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), majoring in Math & CS.  -->
<!-- During my undergraduate studies, I also worked as a student researcher at [RIKEN Center for Brain Science](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/).   -->

### Research
I'm broadly interested in mathematical theory and algorithm. Recently I'm working on the following topics:
*	Statistical and computational learning theory
*	High-dimensional statistics in the proportional asymptotic regime
*	Interplay between high-dimensional probability and convex geometry
*	Combinatorial stochastic processes
